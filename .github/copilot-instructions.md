# react-native-blockly

## Overview
`react-native-blockly` is a React Native package that integrates Google's Blockly library into React Native. This is accomplished using a WebView to wrap an HTML representation of the Blockly workspace, allowing users to create and manipulate block-based code visually.

## Responsibilities for GitHub Copilot

Copilot should help with writing and maintaining clean, modular, and extensible code to this package.

## Core Principles

Our development philosophy is simple: write clear, maintainable code that future developers (including our future selves) can easily understand and extend.

* **Readability First**: Code is written for humans, not just compilers. Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
* **Simplicity and Explicitness**: Avoid overly complex abstractions. Code should be straightforward and its purpose immediately apparent.
* **Consistency is Key**: Adhere to the patterns and structures established in this guide. A consistent codebase is predictable and faster to navigate.
* **Optimize Deliberately**: Write clean, working code first. Only optimize for performance when a clear bottleneck has been identified.

## Code Style
* **Language**: TypeScript is the primary language for this project. Use modern ES6+ features where appropriate.
* **Formatting**: Use Prettier for code formatting. This ensures a consistent style across the codebase.
* **Comments**: Use JSDoc for function and method documentation. Comments should explain the "why" behind complex logic, not the "what" (which should be clear from the code itself).
* **Emojies**: Do not use emojis in code comments or log messages unless they you are told otherwise by the context of the change.
